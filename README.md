# Music-Genre-Classification

This is a project for my fourth semester.

In this project you can use GTZAN Database to run your code.
Link for the database will be given below.

The model classifies the audio files on the basis of MFCC values of a given audio file.

This is a python notebook which was executed on google colab, So to run the code you need to upload the dataset on the your drive and update the locations of the dataset accordingly.
